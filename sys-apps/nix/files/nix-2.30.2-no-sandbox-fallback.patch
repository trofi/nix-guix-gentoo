Subject: [PATCH] src/libstore/globals.hh: disable sandbox fallback

sandbox fallbacks is very dangerous as host's paths tend to leak into
build sandbox all the time from default search paths like /usr/bin.

On linux build sandbox should always be enabled. THere are various
reasons why sandbox fails to be enabled:

- missing 'mount' and 'pid' namespace support in the kernel
- extra (usually read-only) /proc mounts on top of vanilla /proc

Try to address these problems first before trying to disable the
sandbox.
