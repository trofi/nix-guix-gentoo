Subject: [PATCH: core-updates] progress: Call 'time-difference' on times of
 the same type.

Guile 2.2.5 and 2.9.2 would catch the issue.
This is a followup to 88bc3c89bf5145d24c2270d2192b7be547e0024f.

* guix/progress.scm (display-download-progress)[elapsed]: Pass
'current-time' the same type as START-TIME.
